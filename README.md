ABOUT OUR NWHACKS PROJECT -- READYMILK

BACKGROUND

When feeding babies milk, the liquid needs to be heated up and then cooled to room temperature to ensure it is safe for the baby to drink.

PROBLEM

To test if the water is cool enough, people usually shake a few drops of the water on the inside of their wrist; if it stings, itâ€™s still too hot. This is very inconvenient. It would be much easier if people just knew when the milk is at the right temperature.

OUR SOLUTION

Readymilk is a sleeve that wraps around the baby bottle and monitors the temperature of the milk inside. It tells you the current temperature, and lets you know when the milk is ready to feed to the baby.
